# Road Lane Line Detection


![title](/Images/introduction.PNG)


In this project, I implemented a computer vision algorithm that processes real data recorded with the front-facing camera of a vehicle driving on an Israel, 20 Ayalon North on the way to work.
The result is a processed video that highlights the lane lines on the paved road.
